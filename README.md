### ✨ Arch Linux quick Installation:
- A guide to install using the install script:[`Youtube Link`](https://youtu.be/sgDJnaMgtY0) 
- a.) You can install one by one packages above or choose the automatic installer script.
- b.) If you want to add or edit packages, edit install-hyprland script. Ensure packages are present on AUR or official else the script will fail.
- c.) Installation of Asus-ROG-utilities are entirely optional. This is only for Asus Laptop. if you select no, will skip the step.
- d.) Thunar and necessary plugins are entirely optional

### ✨ If upgrading from Hyprland-v2, 
- easy way, ran script, script will create back-up of your files and folders (which needed for the config-dots) so you can easily copy over.
- long way, copy the scripts in config/hypr/scripts and copy to your ~/.config/hypr/scripts . Make sure to make them executable after copied. By running chmod +x filename..
- copy the waybar folder in config/hypr/waybar to your ~/.config/hypr/waybar
- copy the wallpapers to your ~/Pictures . Some scripts are checking those folder. If not, modify the scripts changeWallpaper, dark-light-mode, wallpaper-switcher in your ~/.config/hypr/scripts to your actual wallpapers.

### ✨ Some notes regarding using the install script:
- clone this repo by using git. Change directory, make executable and run the script >cd Hyprland-v2.1 chmod +× install-Hyprland-2.1 ./install-Hyprland-2.1
- Optional stuff you can do using the script includes choices of the following:
-   a.) you can choose either yay or paru (if they are not installed)
-   b.) whether to install none-nvidia patch hyprland package if nvidia gpu detected, 
-   c.) whether to install Catppuccin GTK themes and cursors (Mocha)
-   d.) whether to install thunar and necessary plugins
-   e.) whether to install bluetooth including blueman

### ✨ NVIDIA-Hyprland notes:
- kindly note, on configs I added all the nvidia variables from Hyprland wiki [`Link`](https://wiki.hyprland.org/Nvidia/) but by default they are not enabled. I've had issues like OBS not recording, or intermittent crashing etc, on my laptop. Check the ~/.config/hypr/configs/exec.conf and uncomment one by one to try. You can read through Hyprland-Wiki for some guidance.
